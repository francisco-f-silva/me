# My personal website

This webpage was made as a way to show my projects. The website was initially made using a cool template from [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/), called [Paper Kit 2 - Free Bootstrap 4 UI Kit](http://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit-2), but was modified over the time and no longer looks like the original.

## Quick start

We've also included an optional Gulp file to help you get started with theme customization. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

1.  Download the project's zip
2.  Make sure you have node.js (<https://nodejs.org/en/>) installed
3.  Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4.  You will find all the branding colors inside `assets/scss/paper-kit/_variables.scss`. You can change them with a `HEX` value or with other predefined variables.
5.  Run in terminal `gulp compile-scss` for a single compilation or `gulp watch` for continous compilation of the changes that you make in `*.scss` files. This command should be run in the same folder where `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` are located
6.  Run in terminal `gulp open-app` for opening the Presentation Page (default) of the product.


## Documentation

The documentation for the Paper Kit 2 is hosted at our [website](https://demos.creative-tim.com/paper-kit-2/docs/1.0/getting-started/introduction.html).
